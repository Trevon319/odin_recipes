      <p1>This is an easy grilled peach dessert!
       I use a honey nut flavored cream cheese spread and it's wonderful!
        Drizzle a little extra honey after they're grilled and they're perfect!</p1>

    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
        <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat</li>
        <li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil.</li>
        <li>Place pit side down onto the grill. Grill for 5 minutes,
           or until the surfaces have nice grill marks</li>
        <li>Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey.
           Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place
            where the pit was.</li>
        <li>Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the filling
           is warm. Serve immediately.</li>

      </ol>
